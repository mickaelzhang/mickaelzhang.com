    French student at Hetic and freelancer in my free time. I love learning
    things related to web development. Even though I focus on front-end,
    I enjoy learning more on backend and devops stuff as well. I'm currently
    looking for a 4 month internship in front-end development. Feel free to
    contact me for any inquiries !
